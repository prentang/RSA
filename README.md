# RSA

#Goal The purpose of this project is to implement the RSA public-key cryptosystem.
#The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem is widely used for secure communication in browsers, bank ATM machines,
#credit card machines, mobile phones, smart cards, and operating systems. It works by manipulating integers. To thwart
#eavesdroppers, the RSA cryptosystem must manipulate huge integers (hundreds of digits), which is naturally supported by
#the int data type in Python. Your task is to implement a library that supports core functions needed for developing the RSA
#cryptosystem, and implement programs for encrypting and decrypting messages using RSA.
